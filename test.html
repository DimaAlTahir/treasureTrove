        <li>The results will be recorded on <span class="highlight">the User Acceptance test page</span> linked on the landing page of the app</li>
        <li>Bugs discovered will be noted by the tester(Antreas Messios) and reported by Dima AlTahir in a <span class="highlight">group meeting</span>, to discuss best possible approach to fixing the the different bugs in each aspect.</li>
        <li>Once the bugs are reported and discussed, party responsible for implementing said aspect will fix its bugs <span class="highlight">using the method agreed upon by the group</span>.</li>
